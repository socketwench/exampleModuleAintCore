====================

A Reveal.js presentation for the Twin Cities Drupalcamp 2014 session, "Example Module Ain't Core (But it Ain't Contrib Neither)"

Summary
-------

Drupal 8 is upon us. With a completely new core, developers need solid example code to guide their upgrade efforts. The Example module has long filled this need and will again for Drupal 8.

Or will it? With all the changes in core Examples module is under an extensive rewriting effort. With all the attention on core, it has been difficult to find volunteers and time to develop new examples in advance of a stable version of Drupal 8. How do we solve this?

In this session, we lay out the reasons why Example module isn't in core, but isn't quite the same as any other contrib module. We need a new category and initiative to support contrib developers through the dramatic changes coming in Drupal 8.
